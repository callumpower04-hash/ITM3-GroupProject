                options: [
                    "To directly infect systems with malware",
                    "To manipulate people into revealing confidential information",
                    "To overload network resources with traffic",
                    "To physically damage computer hardware"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Social engineering attacks primarily aim to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, rather than directly attacking technical systems."
            },
            {
                question: "Which of the following is a common characteristic of phishing emails?",
                options: [
                    "They always come from unknown senders",
                    "They use perfect grammar and spelling",
                    "They create a sense of urgency",
                    "They never include links or attachments"
                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency to pressure recipients into acting quickly without proper scrutiny, such as claiming an account will be closed or a limited-time offer is available."
            },
            {
                question: "What is 'pretexting' in social engineering?",
                options: [
                    "Creating a fake scenario to obtain information",
                    "Sending malicious software through email",

                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario or pretext to engage a target and obtain their personal information. The attacker usually impersonates someone with a right to know the information."
            },
            {
                question: "Which of these is the best defense against social engineering?",
                options: [
                    "Using complex passwords",
                    "Keeping software updated",

                    "Installing a firewall"
                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "While all options improve security, security awareness training is the most effective defense against social engineering because it teaches individuals to recognize and resist manipulation attempts."
            },
            {
                question: "What should you do if you receive a suspicious email requesting sensitive information?",
                options: [
                    "Reply to verify the sender's identity",
                    "Forward it to colleagues to warn them",
                    "Contact the organization directly using a verified phone number",

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "The safest approach is to contact the organization directly using a phone number or email address from their official website (not from the suspicious email) to verify the request's legitimacy."
            },
            {
                question: "What is 'tailgating' in physical security social engineering?",

                    "Following someone too closely in traffic",
                    "Gaining unauthorized physical access by following an authorized person",
                    "Sending repeated emails to harass someone",
                    "Creating fake social media profiles"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Tailgating, or piggybacking, is a physical social engineering technique where an unauthorized person follows an authorized person into a restricted area without proper authentication."
            },
            {
                question: "Why do social engineers often use the principle of authority?",
                options: [
                    "Because it makes their requests legally binding",
                    "Because people are more likely to comply with perceived authority figures",
                    "Because it automatically bypasses security systems",
                    "Because it requires less technical knowledge"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Social engineers exploit the human tendency to comply with authority figures, as people are generally conditioned to follow instructions from those perceived to be in positions of power or expertise."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a 'waterholing' attack?",

                    "Poisoning a water supply with malware",
                    "Compromising websites frequently visited by a target group",

                    "Sending emails with water-themed attachments"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "A waterholing attack involves compromising websites that a specific target group frequently visits, then infecting those sites with malware that will be delivered to the visitors."
            },
            {
                question: "Which psychological principle does 'reciprocity' exploit in social engineering?",

                    "The tendency to return favors",
                    "The fear of missing out",
                    "The desire for social validation",
                    "The obedience to authority"
                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Reciprocity exploits the human tendency to feel obligated to return favors. Social engineers might offer something small (like free information) to create a sense of indebtedness."

                question: "What is the primary difference between phishing and spear phishing?",

                    "Spear phishing uses email while phishing uses phone calls",
                    "Phishing targets individuals while spear phishing targets organizations",
                    "Spear phishing is more targeted and personalized",

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Spear phishing is a more targeted version of phishing where attackers customize their messages for specific individuals or organizations, using personal information to increase credibility."
